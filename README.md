LoanGuard – Keeping Loans on Track
Overview;

LoanGuard is a lightweight desktop/web prototype that helps lenders monitor loan health, identify at-risk borrowers early, and simulate repayment behavior to reduce delinquencies.

Problem;
Financial institutions often react too late to loan risk. Early warning signals exist, but they are scattered and not easy to act on quickly.

Solution;

LoanGuard provides:
Clear loan health categories (Healthy / At Risk / Delinquent)
Early warning alerts
Simple repayment simulation
Action-focused dashboard for loan managers

Key Features;
Loan portfolio overview with risk categorization
Early warning alerts for at-risk and delinquent loans
Loan status simulation over time
Portfolio health score
Simple, judge-friendly UI focused on business value

Target Users;
Banks
Credit institutions
Loan servicing teams
Risk & portfolio managers

Built With;
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no backend — demo/prototype focused)
